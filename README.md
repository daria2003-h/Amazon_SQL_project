## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

An **ERD  diagram** is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.
