# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**
![](https://github.com/daria2003-h/Amazon_SQL_project/blob/main/l-intro-1677527302.jpg)
---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

An **ERD  diagram** is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Product performance

  
## **Solving Business Problems**


### 1. Top Selling Products
Query the top 10 products by total sales value.
Challenge: Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.

```sql
WITH 
t1
AS
	(SELECT 
		p.product_name,
		o.price_per_unit,
		SUM(o.quantity) AS total_sold,
		o.price_per_unit*SUM(o.quantity) AS total_sales_value,
		RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY o.price_per_unit*SUM(o.quantity) DESC) AS rank
	FROM order_item AS o
		LEFT JOIN products AS p
		ON p.product_id = o.product_id
	GROUP BY product_name,o.price_per_unit,o.quantity)
SELECT 
	product_name,
	price_per_unit,
	total_sold,
	ROUND(total_sales_value::numeric,2),
	rank
FROM t1
WHERE rank >=10;
```

### 2. Revenue by Category
Calculate total revenue generated by each product category.
Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

```sql

    SELECT 
        c.category_id,
        c.category_name,
        p.product_name,
        o.price_per_unit,
        SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity, -- Aggregate quantity correctly
        SUM(o.price_per_unit * o.quantity) AS total_sales_value -- Correct sales calculation
    FROM order_item AS o
    LEFT JOIN products AS p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
    LEFT JOIN category AS c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.category_id,

        p.product_name,
        o.price_per_unit
),
t2 
AS (
    SELECT 
        category_id,
        category_name,
        ROUND(SUM(total_sales_value)::NUMERIC, 2) AS total_sales, -- Aggregate correctly
        SUM(total_quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM t1
    GROUP BY category_id, category_name
)
SELECT 
    category_id,
    category_name,
    total_sales,

FROM t2
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

Challenge: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT 
        o.customer_id,

        COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders_count, 
        ROUND(SUM(i.quantity * i.price_per_unit)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id), 2) 
		AS average_order_value 
    FROM orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN payments AS p ON p.order_id = o.order_id
    LEFT JOIN order_item AS i ON i.order_id = o.order_id
	JOIN customers AS c

    WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed' 
          AND p.payment_status = 'Payment Successed'
    GROUP BY
		o.customer_id,
